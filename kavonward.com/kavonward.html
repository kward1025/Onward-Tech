            Ok, so this part is what you already know. We are adding
            the stylesheets and the javascript files. What is 
            different is that I added a stylesheet called "normalize.css".
            Now, this is something that we haven't done before, but think of 
            this as a file that sets everything to zero. All of the browers
            have inbuilt styles that they apply automatically. The 
            "normalize.css" is just clearing all of those inbuilt styles
            out so that we starting fresh. I used the Google WebFonts 
            to add some different type of fonts. You did this before
            on another project when you were learning HTML before, but 
            if you need a refresher, go here: https://fonts.google.com/about

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="normalize.css" type="text/css" />
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="kavonward.css" type="text/css" />

        So what I want you to notice about this stylesheet is that I use
a lot of classes instead of Ids. Now, so far you have been using 
Ids to target the html elements. There is nothing wrong with doing
that, but you have more flexibilty by using classes. For example,
we can target multiple menu items by using the .main-menu-item class. 
The way CSS works is that the more specific style gets applied. So, 
'#Nav ul li' is more specific that '.top-menu .main-menu .main-menu-item'.
That is because you are SPECIFICALLY targeting the element names (ul and li).
While the other is NOT SPECIFICALLY targeting any element. Look back through
the HTML/CSS book if you are confused by what I just wrote. 
The other benefit is that you can keep adding classes to elements and 
change their style. Like, if you want to change the bar at the top of
the page, you can just add a "orange-bg" class and boom, its done.

            So when you make new pages, what you will do is copy
            all of this and then empty whatever is in this div with the
            "container" class. You can float stuff in this,
            put elements with "position:absolute" and they won't go
            outside of the container's bounds. 
            By default the style for this has a height of 500px and 
            the overflow is hidden. If you had content that was more
            than 500px tall then you would add classes to override the
            overflow attribute. For example, there is an unused class
            called "show-overflow" in the stylesheet. If had a bunch
            of stuff that you had to put in the container div, then
            what you would do add the "show-overflow" class to it.
