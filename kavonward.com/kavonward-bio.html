                      <q>Kavon served as my legislative fellow from 2007-2008, and during that time, I learned that she is one of the most passionate, hardworking and resilient 
                          individuals I know.  I believe that whatever Kavon writes or speaks will move an audience because she 
                          has lived and overcome a life full of  major obstacles.  Unlike many, Kavon used those obstacles as opportunities 
                          and as a result, has a testimony which I believe will undoubtedly inspire and motivate others.”</q>
